# Bypass Socket Guide

The **bypass socket** is a bi-directional interface that automatically switches its role without manual operation. It can be used as:

- 🔌 Electrical load → Output (power supply)
- ☀️ PV micro-inverter → Input (power generation)

---

## 1. How the System Identifies Devices

The system determines the connected device type based on **power direction + duration**:

| Type           | Detection Condition                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Load           | **Output power above 30 W** for more than 20 seconds |
| Micro-inverter | **Input power above 30 W** for more than 5 seconds   |

> - In off-grid mode, if the bypass socket power is 0 W, the system retains the last detected state.  
> - After restart, the default mode is set to load operation.  

---

## 2. System Behavior in Different Scenarios

System behavior depends on:
- Whether the system is grid-connected or off-grid  
- Whether the connected device is a load or a micro-inverter  

:::info

The power capability of the bypass socket depends on the number of battery packs. A single main unit has limited capacity and may not reach the maximum values listed below. To achieve higher power output, increase the number of battery packs.

Minimum recommended configuration:
- 1 × SolidFlex 2000 + 2 × SFA1800  
- 1 × PowerFlex 2000 + 1 × PFA2000

### 2.1 Grid-Connected + Load

The load is powered by either the grid or the system inverter.

Power range:
- **Up to 3600 W**: normal operation  
- **Above 3600 W** (current ≤ 16 A) for more than 5 seconds: protection is triggered, the bypass socket disconnects, and automatically recovers after 15 minutes  

Battery protection:
- Discharge stops when SOC drops to 5%

---

### 2.2 Grid-Connected + Micro-Inverter

Micro-inverter energy is used for household consumption and battery charging. Excess energy may be fed into the grid within limits.

Power range:
- **Up to 2400 W**: normal operation  
- **Above 2400 W** for more than 30 seconds: protection is triggered, the bypass socket disconnects, and automatically recovers after 15 minutes  

Grid feed-in limit protection:
- If input power exceeds the maximum feed-in power limit by 10% for more than 30 seconds, the system prioritizes disconnecting the bypass socket and recovers after 15 minutes.

---

#### 2.2.1 Energy Behavior in Grid-Connected Mode

In grid-connected operation, the system automatically allocates energy based on the selected energy mode, following a consistent priority:

- First, supply household loads or charge the battery  
- Any remaining energy may be exported to the grid if available  

The priority between load and battery may vary depending on the selected mode.

The **micro-inverter** is used as a **supplementary PV source**, while direct PV serves as the primary source. The system automatically coordinates both, with no manual switching required.


##### What happens to excess energy

When generation exceeds consumption (load is satisfied + battery is full):

| Feed-in Status | System Behavior |
|----------------|----------------|
| Within limit | Excess energy is fed into to the grid |
| Above limit | The system automatically limits output to avoid exceeding the limit:<br />- If the micro-inverter output exceeds the feed-in limit: the bypass socket disconnects<br />- If the micro-inverter is within the limit but direct PV causes the excess: direct PV output is reduced |

---

##### Mode 1: Self-Consumption

1. Micro-inverter power supplies household load first  
2. Remaining energy charges the battery  
3. Once load is met and battery is full, excess follows the [excess energy rule](#what-happens-to-excess-energy)

---

##### Mode 2: Charge/Discharge Schedule

**(1) Charging**

- **A. PV only**
  1. Micro-inverter charges the battery first  
  2. Then supplies household load  
  3. When battery is full and load is satisfied, excess follows the [excess energy rule](#what-happens-to-excess-energy)

- **B. PV + AC**
  1. Direct PV is prioritized for battery charging:
     - If PV is sufficient: PV charges battery, micro-inverter supplies load  
     - If PV is insufficient: micro-inverter assists battery charging, remaining power supplies load  
  2. Once battery is full, micro-inverter prioritizes load supply  
  3. Excess follows the [excess energy rule](#what-happens-to-excess-energy)

**(2) Discharging**

1. Micro-inverter supplies load first  
2. Then charges the battery  
3. Once load is satisfied and battery is full, excess follows the [excess energy rule](#what-happens-to-excess-energy)

---

##### Mode 3: Real-Time Control

**(1) Idle / Charging**

1. Micro-inverter charges the battery first  
2. When the battery is full:
   - If power is 50 W or below: the system maintains the current state for self-consumption  
   - If power exceeds 50 W for more than 30 seconds: the bypass socket disconnects, and direct PV output is reduced to bring system output back to 50 W or below  


**(2) Discharging**

1. Micro-inverter power supplies the load first  
2. Then charges the battery  
3. When battery is full:
   - If power stays within the configured discharge power plus tolerance: normal operation  
   - If power exceeds the configured discharge power plus tolerance: bypass socket disconnects  

> *Tolerance = 50 W or 10% of the configured power (whichever is greater)*  
>
> *Examples:*  
> - *Configured discharge power: 400 W → protection triggered above 450 W*  
> - *Configured discharge power: 800 W → protection triggered above 880 W*

### 2.3 Off-Grid + Load

When the grid is disconnected, the load is powered by the system inverter.

Power range:
- Up to 2400 W + 2% (2448 W): stable operation  
- 2448 W – 2640 W: 30 s overload supported  
- 2640 W – 3000 W: 15 s overload supported  
- Above 3000 W: 100 ms overload supported  
- If the overload exceeds the system capability, the bypass socket disconnects and automatically recovers after 15 minutes  

---

### 2.4 Off-Grid + Micro-Inverter

- EMS below 1.01.05  
  ❌ Micro-inverter not supported (bypass socket disabled for protection)

- EMS 1.01.05 or higher  
  ✅ Micro-inverter supported  
  - Power range: 30 W to 1200 W  
  - When SOC drops below 3%, the inverter temporarily stops responding to micro-inverter input, but the bypass socket remains connected. Once SOC returns to 3% or higher, normal operation resumes automatically

## 3. How to Enable or Disable the Bypass Socket

Control method depends on network status:

| Network status | Control method |
|---------------|----------------|
| Normal        | App / Bluetooth |
| Abnormal      | Bluetooth only |


### Method 1: App Remote Control (Network Available)

Indevolt App → Device → <img src={require("./img/settings_icon.png").default} width="30" style={{verticalAlign: "middle"}}/> → Bypass Socket → Enable Status → Select connected device type

<img src={require("../energy-mode/img/select_device.png").default} width="240"/>

### Method 2: Bluetooth Local Connection (No Network)

App → Profile / Login page → Direct Device Connection → Scan QR code → Connect device → <img src={require("./img/settings_icon.png").default} width="30" style={{verticalAlign: "middle"}}/> → Bypass Socket → Enable

**Off-Grid Sleep Mode**

If the Off-Grid Sleep Mode standby-to-shutdown countdown completes, the device enters **sleep mode** and the Bypass Socket is automatically **turned off**. It can be reactivated by:
1. Short press the power button 
2. Using the appropriate control method based on network status
