# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## 1. Compatibility & Basic Requirements

<details className="custom-details" open>
  <summary className="custom-details__summary">
  1. Q: What specifications of solar panels are compatible with the device?
  </summary>

  A: We recommend solar panels with:
  - Open-circuit voltage (Voc) between **10–60V**
  - Short-circuit current (Isc) not exceeding **20A**
</details>

<details className="custom-details" open>
  <summary className="custom-details__summary">
  2. Q: Can the device operate below 0°C? What is the ideal battery operating temperature range?
  </summary>

  A: The system can charge and discharge normally below 0°C, and PV generation will continue to operate.

  However, winter sunlight conditions may reduce solar production. In such cases, PV power is typically sufficient for self-consumption, minimizing energy waste.

  Recommended battery temperature range:
  - Charging: **-20°C to 55°C**
  - Discharging: **-20°C to 55°C**
</details>

## 2. Installation, Wiring & Operation

<details className="custom-details" open>
  <summary className="custom-details__summary">
  1. Q: Do I need an external microinverter?
  </summary>

  A: For non-Eco models, an additional microinverter is **not required**. The device includes a built-in microinverter with **4 MPPT inputs (Maximum Power Point Tracking)**.

  If higher PV output is required, an external microinverter can be added.

  **Note**: Eco versions do not support MPPT.
</details>

  <summary className="custom-details__summary">
  2. Q: What should I pay attention to before installing or adding expansion batteries?
  </summary>

  A: The system **must be powered off** before adding expansion batteries. Hot-plugging may damage the product.

  Proper procedure:
  1. Disconnect the AC power plug  
  2. Press and hold the power button for 2 seconds to turn off the device  
  3. Insert the expansion battery after shutdown  
  4. Reconnect the solar panels and resume operation

<details className="custom-details" open>
  <summary className="custom-details__summary">
  3. Q: Can the system operate during a power outage?
  </summary>

  A: Yes. During a grid outage, the system can continue operating and charge via PV.

  The maximum off-grid output power depends on the specific product model.
</details>

<details className="custom-details" open>
  <summary className="custom-details__summary">
  4. Q: Can the grid port be used during a power outage?
  </summary>

  A: No. In accordance with anti-islanding safety standards, the system will not feed power into the grid during an outage.

  During a grid outage, only the off-grid (EPS) output can supply loads.
</details>

  <summary className="custom-details__summary">
  5. Q: What is Bypass Mode?
  </summary>

  A: Bypass Mode allows the system to support specific external devices such as microinverters or critical loads.

  When enabled:
  - You can select the connected device type in the device or app settings  
  - The app will display corresponding device icons and energy flow status. 
</details>

<details className="custom-details" open>
  <summary className="custom-details__summary">

## 3. Expansion, Battery & Parallel Operation

<details className="custom-details" open>
  <summary className="custom-details__summary">
  1. Q: What are the functions and usage of Cluster Mode?
  </summary>

  A: Cluster Mode allows multiple identical Micro Energy Storage devices (e.g., multiple SolidFlex 2000 units) to be networked via wireless or wired connections for coordinated operation.

  Key functions include:

  - **Unified scheduling:** Multiple devices share load information and distribute charge/discharge power according to preset rules to improve overall efficiency.  
  - **Capacity stacking:** The total battery capacity of multiple devices is combined to meet higher load or longer runtime requirements.  
  - **Redundancy backup:** If one device fails, other devices can continue operating to ensure power supply stability.

  Setup steps:

  After adding and connecting all devices in the app, go to device settings page, select **Cluster**, follow the prompts to add devices to the cluster, and complete pairing to enable Cluster Mode. 
  
  You can also configure power distribution rules and SOC thresholds in this interface.
</details>

  <summary className="custom-details__summary">
  2. Q: Can PowerFlex and SolidFlex systems operate together in Cluster Mode?
  </summary>

  A: Currently, PowerFlex and SolidFlex systems support mixed operation in Cluster Mode.
</details>

<details className="custom-details" open>
  <summary className="custom-details__summary">
  1. Q: The battery parameter shows a maximum power of 2400W, but the current default configuration is 800W. Can the power be adjusted to 2400W?
  </summary>

  A: The discharge capability depends on the number of battery packs installed.

  To increase discharge power to 2400W, additional battery packs are required. Simply adjusting software parameters cannot increase hardware power output.

  After adding battery packs, discharge capability will increase accordingly. Ensure circuit load compatibility to avoid device failure due to excessive load.
</details>

<details className="custom-details" open>
  <summary className="custom-details__summary">
  4. Q: How is power distributed when multiple devices operate in parallel?
  </summary>

  A: The system uses a hierarchical power distribution strategy based on SOC level and load power:

  - When discharge power is below **200W**, the device with the highest SOC supplies the entire load.  
  - When discharge power is between **200W and 500W**, two devices with higher SOC share the load.  
  - When discharge power exceeds **500W**, all subdevices participate in discharge, and power is allocated proportionally based on SOC.
</details>

<details className="custom-details" open>
  <summary className="custom-details__summary">
  5. Q: What is the maximum number of SolidFlex 2000 devices and SFA1800 battery modules supported?
  </summary>

  A:

  - **Maximum device count:**  
    - Up to 3 SolidFlex 2000 units can form a wireless cluster.  
    - One Shelly current transformer can control these 3 units.  
    - Each SolidFlex 2000 can support up to 5 SFA1800 battery modules.  
    - Maximum capacity per unit is 10.8 kWh (5 SFA1800 modules).

  - **Total discharge power limit:**  
    - Rated discharge power of one SolidFlex 2000 is 2400W.  
    - When 3 units operate in cluster mode, the total discharge power limit is 7200W (3 × 2400W).
</details>

<details className="custom-details" open>
  <summary className="custom-details__summary">
  6. Q: After connecting multiple SolidFlex 2000 units, will firmware or system software limit total power output? What is the maximum total capacity recognized by the app?
  </summary>

  A:

  - **Firmware power limit:**  
    When multiple SolidFlex 2000 battery clusters are connected, firmware does not restrict total power output. Users can adjust system power settings in the app as needed (ensure circuit load capacity is not exceeded).

  - **App capacity recognition:**  
    The app does not impose a maximum recognized system capacity. For example, if two SolidFlex 2000 units are connected, the app will display each unit’s installed capacity separately and also show the total cluster capacity.
